Assignment #: 1

Source code (.java) file name(s):

    BoggleGame.java

Does your program compile without errors?:
    
    Yes

If not, what is/are the error(s)?:
    
    N/A

Does your program run without errors?:
    
    No

If not, what is/are the error(s) and which parts of your
program run correctly?:

    I was not able to complete the main "solve" algorithm, leading to an incomplete project. I did not start on any of the other methods because they all required the main algorithm to work, which I was unable to do.


Additional comments (including problems and extra credit):

    I did not work on the other methods assigned because of issues with the main algorithm. At first, I started writing my own from scratch (countWords_helper), but realized it was not properly utilizing the backtracking method that was discussed during lecture. I then turned to the code from Lab 1 to see if I could gain some help from it, but had multiple issues with the searchPrefix method. Basically, the value of "res" would continue to remain at 0 despite searchPrefix being called each iteration - this led to the recursive if-statements becoming useless, as the count could never increase and the board could not be solved.

    I apologize for not being able to finish this assignment, I started it a bit too late and, despite going to office hours, struggled with debugging my algorithm each time I ran into issues. I hope that some partial credit can be earned on my part (possibly anything other than a 0), as I did put a lot of time and effort into this project and want to improve at coding throughout this class.

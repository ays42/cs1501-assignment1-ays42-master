2. countWords_helper
    > READ ME - I'm deciding to put a writeup of the method I created rather than writing one about the method used in Lab 1. I hope that is okay, as I feel you would rather read the writeup of a method you're not familiar with instead of the one I turned to for help. The writeup for solveForWordLength will equate what my prospective writeup for the "solve" method would be (if that makes sense). 
    > Data Structures - 2-D Array
    > Algorithm - This recursive method would first append the first letter of the board to an empty StringBuilder object (sb). Then, it would assign the "res" value according to the results of the searchPrefix call on sb. I set up something similar to the Lab 1 chain of if-statements that handled the result of what value was assigned to res. Once that was dealt with, I recursed for each next possible square in the boggle board by using nested for-loops. I then called another helper method from Lab 1 (indexIsValid) to make sure the square visited could be used.
    > Coding/Debugging Issues - I used print statements within each if-statement/for-loop to track where my algorithm could be wrong. Many times, the count would either not count correctly, or would be the square of the input size of the board (for example, if I input the size as 4, the count would return as 16). Soon, I abandoned this homemade method because I never integrated a backtracking method, and wasn't sure if the one used in Lab 1 would work alongside countWords_helper.
    > Asymptotic Analysis - The first half of this method shares a runtime of 1, as the first for-loop only appears in line 64. The nested for loop (line 65) will have a runtime of n, as well as the print statement below it. The fist if-statement we see is to check if the index is valid, which will have a runtime of n/2. The second if-statement below is completely dependent on what the res value is, as well as whether the character on the board is lowercase or not.

3. indexIsValid
    > Data Structures - 2-D Array
    > Algorithm - This is the same method used in Lab 1, and the algorithm only consists of 3 separate if-statements. First, we call the Tile class so we can determine where each tile is lying. Then, we check whether the tile used in that moment is outside of the board/a valid direction to move. We do this by comparing the value of tiles.row and tiles.col to the boggleBoard.length. We also have to make sure that the character we're moving to is uppercase, or else it has already been used.
    > Coding/Debugging Issues - N/A
    > Asymptotic Analysis - The whole method has a runtime of O(1).

4. nextChar
    > Data Structures - 2-D Array
    > Algorithm - This method is solely used for the purpose of appending the next char to the current solution. This was also a helper method from Lab 1.
    > Coding/Debugging Issues - N/A
    > Asymptotic Analysis - The whole method has a runtime of O(1).

5. resetBoard
    > Data Structures - 2-D Array
    > Algorithm - This helper method from Lab 1 is used to reset the whole board. This will come in handy whenever the board needs to be analyzed from a different perspective after a method has already been called on it.
    > Coding/Debugging Issues - N/A
    > Asymptotic Analysis - Inside the 2 nested for-loops, it will take a runtime of O(n) to reach the statement that sets the characters of the board to uppercase.

6. countWordsOfCertainLength
    > Data Structures - 2-D Array
    > Algorithm - This algorithm is used to find words of a specific length, decided by what the user input is. It calls the helper method "resetBoard" so the board can be "unused" and iterated through.
    > Coding/Debugging Issues - N/A
    > Asymptotic Analysis - Inside the 2 nested for-loops, it will take a runtime of O(n) to reset the board, and call the helper method of this method.

6. solveForWordLength
    > Data Structures - 2-D Array
    > Algorithm - This algorithm is identical to the "solve" method used in Lab 1, except adds an extra parameter of what the desired word length is.
    > Coding/Debugging Issues - I never finished this method, because I was never able to completely finish the "solve" method. I never really got to test it, but I'm fairly certain it doesn't work since I never implemented the parameter "wordLength."
    > Asymptotic Analysis - The method contains a big for loop that all the code is used in, which means nothing in this method can achieve a constant runtime. If the direction is valid, the StringBuilder will append the character and set the used tile to lowercase. Then, unlike the solve method, it SHOULD use the wordLength parameter to search for words of that length and increment the global "count" variable. This method should then recurse until all words of desired length are found.
